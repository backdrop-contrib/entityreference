Entity Reference
================

**Entity Reference module will be (was) moved into Backdrop core 1.23.0. Use of this module is no longer necessary 
and no further changes will be made here. If you would like to report a bug or request 
against Entity Reference, file an issue in the main Backdrop CMS core repository at 
https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues.**

Provides a field type that can reference arbitrary entities. For example, there 
could be "team" and "player" content types, and each player could have a field 
where authors could select which team they belong to.

Installation
------------

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at <https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules>.

Configuration
-------------

1. To add an entity reference field to a node, navigate to Administration >
   Structure > Content types > [content type to edit] > Manage fields and
   add a new field. Add a title and select the entity reference field type.
   Select a widget: Select list, Autocomplete (Tags style), Autocomplete, or
   Check boxes/radio buttons. Save.
2. From the Field Setting tab select the entity reference "Target type":
   Node, Comment, File, User, Taxonomy term, or Taxonomy vocabulary.
3. From the Field Setting tab select select the Entity Selection Mode -
   Simple (with optional filter by bundle) is the default. Select how to
   Sort: Don't sort, A property of the base table of the entity, or A field
   attached to this entity. Select the sort field or property and the sort
   direction. Save.

Now when authoring content there is an option to make reference to another
entity.

Too many entities
-----------------

Note that when using a select widget, Entity reference loads all the
entities in that list in order to get the entity's label. If there are
too many loaded entities that site might reach its memory limit and crash
(also known as WSOD). In such a case you are advised to change the widget
to "autocomplete". If you get a WSOD when trying to edit the field
settings, you can reach the widget settings directly by navigation to

  `admin/structure/types/manage/[ENTITY-TYPE]/fields/[FIELD-NAME]/widget-type`

Replace ENTITY-TYPE and FIELD_NAME with the correct values.
